1. You might like to look for trends in your data by month of collection across years.
	Part 1. How do you sort your data by month?
		I'd sperate the month day and year from the data, then go into the collumn options and sort by value, IE, 1 = January, 2 = Feburay
	Part 2. How would you do this differently if you were instead trying to see all your entrues in chronological order?
		I'd combine all the values into a new column, set up like yr,month,day. Then sort this column by value.
2. What is the major benefit of reconciliation? What did reconciliation do?
	It adds data/background infromation on our scientific names. It created links that showed what the thing was. How it looked like, where is comes from, its altruibutes.
